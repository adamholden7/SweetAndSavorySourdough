    <h1>Spring Steelhead Report – April 2025</h1>
    <p>
      Flows have stabilized and water temps are creeping into that sweet spot for fresh fish pushing into the system.
      We’ve been seeing a steady trickle of bright steelhead moving through classic runs and tailouts.
    </p>

    <h2>Flows &amp; Water Clarity</h2>
    <p>
      The river is running slightly above average for this time of year with 2–3 feet of visibility. It’s still cold,
      so focus on the softer seams and deeper slots where fish can rest.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s Working</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Egg patterns in soft inside bends</li>
      <li>Small black stoneflies nymphed tight to the bottom</li>
      <li>Muted streamers swung slow on sink tips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Windows</h2>
    <p>
      Late morning into mid-afternoon has been most consistent as temps bump a couple of degrees. If you’re flexible,
      aim for days with a gentle warm-up and cloud cover.
